In the past, we have had overseas programs pay for the plane ticket (around $700-$1,200) and we cover the rest.  I got a really good deal last time I booked an overseas program and ended up paying $750 for a 2 way ticket.  I will use my skills to try and secure the best deal possible ;-)  
We prefer to have all of the expenses  prepaid for the validator prior to their arrival.   IF we decide to have someone pick her up,  Is there a way we can go ahead and pay for the transportation to and from the airport?  Is there a rental car place on base? Or should she just get a rental from the airport and drive herself?   I'm afraid if she doesn't get a rental car, she will have trouble getting around base to eat and getting to and from your program.  These trips are always a little tricky to book.  I will try and confirm your window by next Tuesday so that we can get everything squared away.[Sarah Keeth]",Tanya Trujillo-Martinez,Sarah Keeth,Completed

Programs have been instructed to follow the guidelines I provided to make sure the VV request arrives in time to schedule the visit when the program has 75% occupancy and before the awd extension expires.  Ana said she didn't have time to 'do all of that paperwork' and submit early.  In the past we have jumped through serious hoops to get their decisions done on time. The new system means we no longer do that. She decided that she would be able to get the info here in time for a May visit.

Have a great day. 
 For criteria C7,  We have the card for each staff member from the American Heart Association that lists both infant and child CPR and first aid as well as adult.  Do I need to make two copies of each card for both 1 and 2?  It says that information for each indicator must be kept separate but that seems incredibly redundant.  
You do not need to make separate copies (although that was an excellent question!).  That would be quite redundant!
Also, for indicator number 3, what exactly are you looking for?  The cards state the training center and the id number of the instructor per AHA.  And if that is what you need, do I need to make a third copy for indicator 3?
 
No, as long as the card states the training center and the ID#, you are good to go!

I said I am 100% sure that you do, and in the past, Jeanine submitted a report for all 9 schools together, too, so I'm sure that's where that's coming from and it is incorrect information. She also asked about reports and a ""lump sum"" - i said I can't confirm or deny anything regarding payment for this particular situation, because I don't know anything about it, it's probably something KP knows the most about if you would like for me to leave a note for her to call you.

Tammy (works with all 3) emailed to say they do naptime trainings because otherwise they have to pay their staff and that is too expensive.

1.The Director at Vista Colina has mentioned that she has not heard anything from NAC; is this because now that the organization is offering the eight week window there will no longer be a two week window notification? 
The 8 week window is so that directors will have an idea of when the visit will be scheduled.  Once I confirm a validator, I will contact the director with a two week window that falls within the 8 week timeframe.  Their timeframe ends on 6/27.

She said KC has been systematically disabling the @klcorp e-mails and issuing new e-mail addresses. She said hers was disabled somewhere around end of July and she was given larallen@kindercare.com. She didn't think about notifying us about this; she's still learning a lot on the job. She's so glad she called to check on it. I thanked her for checking with us. Talked about how frequently we send e-mails. Let her know I will resend DCW letter. She asked if she still has to have it done by tomorrow. Told her no, I'll give her new 30 days. She said she'll definitely get it done before then. She's nervous about VVR due in Dec. Told her we also need last 2 LR for her COD. She said she has the latest one, but she's reorganizing right now to figure out where everything is, and she'll find the other one. Told her to send to submissions@ and they'll get passed on to me.

I reviewed the request for validation visit for both programs and have several concerns.  I understand that you wanted an expedited visit and decision, however it seems as if both programs are not ready for a validation visit.  I spoke with my Executive Director and she agreed to refund the expedite fees.  We do not typically refund any fees, however we understand loosing $1000 could be devastating to a private program.  We will keep your current validation visit fees on file for 1 year and will apply them when the programs are ready to request for a validation visit again.

You have very little block out dates within your timeframe.  Please do not assume that we know all KinderCare dates for professional development days, early release days, fieldtrips and/or holidays in general.  When I call you and give you your two week window, you will not be able to add any block out dates at that time.  Even if you forgot to inform me about a professional development day, there are no exceptions.  You will have to pay a $500 re-scheduling fee + any non-refundable validator travel expenses before another visit can be scheduled. I am stressing this now because many programs don' t take me seriously until they are faced with a reschedule.  You can continue to email block out dates to this email address up until the moment I call you with a two week window.  Let me know if you have any questions.

I emamiled why that was not acceptable: Responses must be specific to the program, since the solution should also be specific to the program. What addresses a concern at one program will likely never be exactly how a concern is resolved at another. Differences in the level of understanding Child Development for the infant staff, storage of the bottles, transitions, the personalities of the babies in care, distractions due to the building layout and many other factors can influence the procedures that are needed to gain compliance in this area.  In the future, provide details that reflect the actions taken for your program.  Told both nothing else was needed.[Ruth La Brayere]",Amanda Johnson,Ruth La Brayere,Completed

You can submit additional block out dates up until the day I call you to confirm your two week window.

Licensing found no evidence to cite us- however  both Jessica & myself felt uneasy with the teacher's attitude during the investigation.
We invited the teacher to return conditionally with training on child guidance.
The teacher declined and never resumed employment with us.
 
Please let me know if you need anything else.

The teacher, Sabrina Malone, was in a classroom with 13 school aged children. The children were at three different tables at the front of the classroom doing activities. Three six year old boys were sitting together. Sabrina saw them acting suspiciously. She said that they looked like they were hiding something. She went to the three and saw that one child had his pants unzipped and his privates showing. Sabrina was standing about six feet away when she spotted the activity. 
 Sabrina sent them to me immediately. 
When I spoke with the children one child admitted to inappropriate touching, one child admitted to having his pants unzipped and his privates showing, and one child denied touching anyone. 
I called licensing that afternoon and made a report. I spoke with each parent and let them know there was to be an investigation.
 When licensing investigated she questioned the children and their stories were inconsistent.  She told me at the time of her visit that she could not determine what had happened.
  I did not agree with the outcome, because my teacher intervened. The children were within sight and sound, the teacher did not have her back turned to the children, and she was moving around the class and interacting with children. The children were in control. 
 I counseled with my regular licensing agent and she advised me to rearrange the tables in the classroom and space the children further apart. 
 We went over the situation and have changed table top grouping with children to have more space between them.
 During the investigation I counseled with my District manager and my H.R. department of our company and they agreed that the teacher properly supervised the children and intervened in a timely manner

My bus driver Cheryl Yant had one child on the bus and was on her way to pick up other children at 3:30 . She was yielding to traffic, and when she proceeded she bumped the car in front of her. 
 There were no injuries and there was no damage to the car, she was traveling less than five miles an hour. The police were call per our protocol and she received a ticket. I reported the incident to licensing and our corporate office immediately, and called the parent of the child within one hour. 
 We were not sited by licensing.
 Cheryl was removed from our driver list and is no longer able to drive our bus. I had all drivers go through safe drivers training in June.

Melissa was new and had only been in her classroom for three weeks. She had completed her orientation training including transitions and supervision. At 5:30pm the three  year old' s were on the playground when the classrooms combined with the two year olds at the end of the day. Those children were added to her child supervision record. As she transitioned the children back into the building one child went around a brick partition to another classroom door that was locked. Melissa was checking the name to face record to verify that all children had re-entered the building when the mother came and saw the child at the glass door. The child was not upset, and was knocking on the door trying to get in. The child was unsupervised for a brief period of time, approximately one to two minutes. I feel her teacher would have detected her absence as she completed her name to face.
 Melissa was re-trained on transition time, to conduct name to face attendance as the children cross the threshold.   Thank you for your time, and please feel free to call if you have any questions.[Sarah Keeth]",Carolyn De Los Santos,Sarah Keeth,Completed

A17: We have 2 part time employees (Maya Bausley and Kaitlynn Skinner) that are 17 years old (they will not turn 18 until February and June). Kaitlynn was hired after our request for validation visit paperwork was submitted. Since A17 states ""not counted in the staff-child ratio"", that is why it is checked needs improvement. We count both of them in the staff:child ratio.
C2: We do not require a ""physician's statement of health and ability to participate in group care on file within 6 months of enrollment"". Honestly, we were not sure what that meant (thought maybe a doctor's note release?) So we meet all of C2 except that indicator, making it needs improvement.
Training Log for Jessica Sharp attached. She currently has 8 hours and will finish her remaining 12 hours before December 31, 2012.

Please let me know if you need any additional information.(Amy' s typical work schedule 7-3/ Linda' s typical work schedule 10-6)We have a Monona Grove School District 4K program on site that is located in the Butterfly Room. The hours are 7:50-10:40. Some of the children are also enrolled in our wrap around program and go into the Firefly room for the remainder of the day. The children that are not enrolled in Learning Ladder for the wrap around care are dropped off and picked up by parents or they ride the school district bus. Jodi and Emily work in the T4K room. They both are full time employees but work spilt shifts as they are assigned to the school-age classrooms in the afternoon (Butterfly & Dragonfly). Jodi is our School-Age Coordinator.       For our after school-age children ages K-2 are transported to the Black Bear (the parking lot next to our building). A teacher (Jodi) meets the children at the bus and walks them into the building. The 2nd -4th grade children are transported by Learning Ladder buses. There are two 5th grade children that arrive by a school district bus and walk themselves into the building. Wednesdays are swimming lessons. Ten children have signed up for swimming and are transported to a swimming pool facility each Wednesday morning. Amy and Kerry supervise and transport the children is the Learning Ladder bus. They leave the building at 10:00 am and return at 11:30.[Sarah Keeth],Linda and Amy Kudrna,Sarah Keeth,Completed

Spoke to Donna (not sure of position, but was very knowledgeable about their AR, so maybe AD?). I told her we had gotten multiple copies of the AR and I wanted to check which one was their official submission or if there was a difference. Donna told me that Ashley had mailed the first one, got a notice from the post office that it was undeliverable, so she tried to fax, but then the fax didn't work right, so she just sent another copy by UPS. UPS copy is the one I got yesterday, USPS is the one I got today. Donna said she thinks they're exactly the same, but might as well go with the UPS one to be safe.

FOR EXAMPLE: *She indicated that in the Three's class the children were given a choice of a snack bar or an apple. At the time the teacher tossed the snack bar in front of the child. This was actually our VPK class and not the Three's class. She did not observe during the Three's snack time. *She also commented that a child was told no to washing hands because they had done so 10 minutes prior. This was actually said in the Two's classroom not the Three's.

Just an FYI on the Schaumburg, KinderCare visit.  The director continually brought up her dismay with the other validator/visit.  But in the validators defense, her paperwork was not complete.  You would have thought she would have fixed this before her re-visit.  Her file folders all there but when I opened them they stated, In office or in binder.  Since I knew how disgruntled she was from before I was extra sweet and went through each file and explained I needed the information in my hand (files), not in binders in her office.  She was compliant and worked with her assistant director to find everything while I did classroom observation and training logs.  She seemed very pleased with the visit and experience, which was positive�.but I wanted you to know the whole story.  Hopefully now she understands what her expectations are as a director and paperwork.

Thank you for your compliment. We tried to be as accurate as possible.
My business license reads KinderCare Learning Center. Because we are
located on the church property the name on the building is Christian Kids. 
Department of Human Services has us listed as Christian Kids on our license.
We are owned and operated by KinderCare. We added Kindercare to our current 
license report this year. So hopefully it will be updated to reflect Christian Kids @ KinderCare
Learning Center #301492. We are all one in the same.

After a careful second review of the documents you sent in for a re-accreditation, we have determined that your program is not ready for a validation visit.  Your program' s validation visit has been placed on hold until you have had sufficient time to correct/address several of the standards listed below.  We want you to be successful and feel that you need to remain in the self-study process for a minimum of 6 months before you request a validation visit.  Your current self-study does not expire until 8/29/2013, however your current award expires 3/9/2013.  Remaining in the self-study process for a minimum of 6 months will cause you to laps in accreditation, but you will still be considered in good standing with NAC until the self-study expiration date.  Do not hesitate to email me with any questions you may have.  
Training - It has been determined that 0% of your staff (including yourself) meet the # of required training hours per year.  Several staff members (not counting those hired in 2012) did not receive any training in 2012.  In addition to the insufficient # of hours, the training provided was not from a variety of sources and not directly related to each staff members age group they work with.  
�Parent Survey - Though we do not require all standards to be met, standards B6, B8, B10, B11, C19 & D4 should be met by the time you are up for re-accreditation.  
�Staff Survey - Standards A2, A12, A16, A17, A18, B1, B9, D9, & D17 should also be met by the time you are up for re-accreditation.  I did not include all unmet standards above, only the standards that are considered high risk if unmet by the time you are up for re-accreditation.  
�Licensing Reports - It is concerning that you were sited more than once in the same year for being out of ratio.  Though we do not require standards C23, C34, & C25 in the staff survey to be met (these standards were unmet as well in your staff survey) in order to have a validation visit, it is apparent that these standards are affecting the quality of your program.  There were several reports of insufficient staff and child files and a report stating that a background check was not completed timely.  It was also noted that a child was given the wrong dosage of medication in August of 2011, this deficiency alone will require 2 clean licensing reports before a reaccreditation visit will be granted.[Sarah Keeth]",Tinesha Davis,Sarah Keeth,Completed

Said if she reenrolled the programs right away they would not have to wait an additional 6 months.  Said she might be able to have a few days added to the SS exp date.  Immediately regretted it since it might make her rush those that aren't ready and we would not receive the money.  I didn't say it was a definite thing.

About a 45 minute conversation. She was at first under the impression she had to do 1 joint one for all 15 (I'm assuming that was Jeanine's input), then I said no it would be one for each location, she panicked, I said but it shouldn't be 15 that doesn't sound right, checked and it's 9 (Deep Creek, East, Liberty, Meadow Park, Myakka, Neil Armstrong, Peace River Sallie Jones, Vineland) - had a long discussion concerning what was expected. Told her it's individual VVR's for each location, she had a hard time understanding that pg 118 had everything that was necessary for each VVR - kept asking if she had to include this, this, etc. I kept confirming that yes, everything on pg 118 is what needs to be in each individual VVR. She then said okay what is the docbox I'm supposed to submit to you, what am I sending to you? I said everything on pg 118, that list is what makes up the VVR. Had a hard time understanding that as well, kept rephrasing the question, kept answering as best I could. She is very very new and with little to no training, I told her I can help her with the very basic levels of the VVR but once she gets into the nuts and bolts of it, if Nicole isn't helping (and I told her that Nicole SHOULD be helping every step of the way, and if she isn't, to contact us) to reach out to LG and gave her her phone number for that/for when I'm not here. I am sure she will be in contact again - if she calls/e-mails, please respond promptly - the 9 VVR's are due 11/3 and she is kind of on her own from the sound of it.[Sydney Forbis]",Nicole Hansen and Nora Koran,Sydney Forbis,Completed

She said I'm just trying to figure out this mess. Where did it go? I said the zip code is from our old address. She said ""there's no forwarding address?"" I said no maam, the association hasn't operated out of that building for at least a year now, i'm confused about why it wouldn't have just come back to you, she was too, said it was 2 weeks ago, strange that it wouldn't have come back to them. I said is there an electronic copy of the report? She said I have it right here, I said okay great, go ahead and resend that and we're all good. She wanted to fax it, gave her our fax number, asked about payment because the check for the resub hasn't cleared, I said that's fine, and I asked if there was a check with it, she said yes, I said go ahead and cancel that, better to be safe than sorry. She said well he mailed it to the address on the form he had. I said he probably has an old form, when our address changed all that information went out to everyone and said our online forms are the ones with the most current address. She then said well I know 3 other centers had their reports due in June, did they arrive? I said yes, 2 came by mail, one by e-mail. She said okay I'll fax this one out today, and is there a way he (Steven) can pay online? I said yes, our AP person can do that, not sure if she's in today but she will be tomorrow, so I'll leave a note for her - she said actually can he pay over the phone?

There is not a single standard that if unmet at the time of the validation visit, would prevent a program from achieving accreditation.  It is ok if the teacher does not quite meet education requirements if you are confident she is able to lead a classroom (this is probably my favorite thing about NAC).  I can also instruct the validator to just do a walk through on the toddler room to check for safety standards.  The validator only validates 75% of classrooms, so we can tell the validator not to observe that room.  I apologize for not responding sooner.  We were in FL, hosting our annual conference last week.  Let me know if you have any questions.

He said I was responsible for information that didn't come to my personal e-mail? I said this is the e-mail we have on file for the program and I can add his if he wants, but this is the e-mail we were given to send information. He said ""I guess this is going to go nowhere and you're not going to back down"". I said ""No, sir."" He said he'll pay the fee for what he guesses is his mistake and move on. I told him please do make sure you read the 4-year update since it has important information about other parts of accreditation. He said he did read it.  It was faxed to his whole staff and they read it together, he must have just missed the part about how we moved. He said he'll read it again. Took cc payment of $365.

Not only was her paperwork stolen off her porch, but I didn' t realize that Children' s Choice was only open for 3 hours a day (this was totally my fault).  After a looooonnnngggg conversation with Erica, I told her to try and get in 7 observations over the course of the 2 day visit and spend 35-45 minutes in each room.  I told her not to worry about seeing lunch or snack in all of the classes, just observe what she could and have the director initial under the standards she was not able to observe (in the director' s response box).  
I also told her to notify the director that operating hours would need to be devoted strictly to observations and after hours Erica could verify the Doc Box and files.  Since she didn' t have the paperwork with her, I instructed her to have the director circle the indicators and MS or NI in the admin report before she started to verify.  I verified that the director had the classroom observations handy and that they were filled out correctly.
